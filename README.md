# Box Game
I am making a puzzle game that centers around the player
manipulating boxes to move through obstacles in levels.

# About
The main function of the box is to grow and shrink and be moved. 
There are 3 levels where the player encounters unique challenges
and must think to complete the level. The limiting factor is the
player's mana, you only have a limited amount per level and external
factors sometimes change between levels like the gravity. However,
if the player gets stuck, they can always reset the level.
