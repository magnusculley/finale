## Pitch and Description
I am making a puzzle game that centers around the player
manipulating boxes to move through obstacles in levels. The main
function of the box is to grow and shrink and be moved. 
By the end of Phase 3 I hope to have a fully functional game
with at least 3 levels with unique obstacles.

### Phase 1:
- [x] Create an environment for the player
- [x] The player can be controlled with the keyboard
- [x] The player can move, jump, and is restrained in the window
- [x] The boxes can be manipulated with the mouse
#### Phase 2:
- [] The player can jump on the box
- [] The player can win a level
- [] The player has a set amount of 'mana' to manipulate the boxes
##### Phase 3:
- [] 3 unique levels
- [] Unique obstacles that offer different challenges/solutions
- [] Ability to reset a level if the player gets stuck
